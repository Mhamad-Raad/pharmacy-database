this is a simple database for a pharmacy.
has little bugs which will be fixed in the future.
done with asp .net.
the system is when a certain shop has few staff members that has to log in order to keep history for the day.
this is website application that is using the mvc architecture design where the medicine and the staff memebers are the module,
and the aspx is the view. with controllers.
